This research will explore the use of time series machine learning models to forecast national house price trends using macroeconomic indicators. While traditional house price models often rely on property-level features, this study shifts focus to broader economic variables such as Gross Dometic Product (GDP), mortgage rates, employment levels, and inflation that significantly influence housing market dynamics. Building on (3) foundational research papers, this study integrates advanced methods in explainable boosting, loss function optimization, and interpretable local modeling to enhance both accuracy and transparency.  

We develop a time-aware XGBoost model and evaluate its performance using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. An expanding-window validation approach is applied to maintain temporal integrity, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used to interpret how each economic factor contributes to price fluctuations over time. Through this paper, readers will gain insight into how machine learning particularly XGBoost can be adapted for time series forecasting, how model interpretability can be preserved using SHAP, and how tailoring loss function can improve real-world relevance. The study ultimately provides a replicable and transparent modeling approach that can aid financial institutions, housing analysts, and policymakers in understanding and anticipating housing market trends.
